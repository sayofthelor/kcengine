cool [fnf](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) engine

name inspired by my youtube handle lmao

got da

* downscroll
* multiple keybind presets (the famous DFJK too!!)
* ghost tapping
* time bar
* funky note splashes
* events (which you can add in charting!)
* soft coded weeks & characters (and their healthbar colors!)

in da works:
* better dialogue system
* softcoded title screen text
* more events than bf's "hey!"
* better charting (copy/paste section, etc)

to be added:
* note skins
* change settings from using `FlxG.save` to using json
* stage editor
* hscript modding support
* plugin support
